# Python Projects

This is a list of all my small Python projects which are not big enough to warrant their own repository.

## Calculator

This is a calculator app which converts user button clicks into a postfix expression and computes a result. It includes negative numbers, parentheses, and order of operations to calculate complex expressions.

## Mouse Controller

This program allows me to control my computer's mouse using a USB video game controller. 

It uses the left joystick for movement, the bottom button to left click (X on PS4), the top button to right click (triangle on PS4), and the start button to exit the program.

It uses a PyGame event loop to capture controller input and PyAutoGUI for moving and clicking the mouse.
